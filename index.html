          <h2>Assistive Foot Pedal Device</h2>
          <p class="project-desc">
            <b>
              For my senior project I worked with a group of 3 other electrical
              and computer engineers to design an adaptable assistive foot pedal
              system. My contribution consisted of writing all the software, our
              language of choice was python and I developed a library which used
              observers to interact with the arduino on the pedals. A developer
              could then use my library to write applications for using the foot
              pedals.

          <p class="project-desc">
            <b>
              The final assignment for a multimedia systems class was to
              implement an algorithm from any scholarly source. I decided to
              work on motion tracking using a strategy which analysis color
              video, this concept was originally used in game development in the
              early 2000's. I used Python for the project along with the
              libraries numpy and cv2.

          <p class="project-desc">
            <b>
              When I started working as a full stack developer at UIC my first
              project was to build the dining and nutrition menu website for
              resident students. The website informs UIC residents about what
              food is being served at the multiple cafeterias on campus with
              options to filter the options by day or dietary restrictions. This
              was the first front-end project I built using Vue and I'm very
              proud of how it turned out.

          <h2>UIC Locker Registration Site</h2>
          <p class="project-desc">
            <b>
              The UIC locker registration site is a site used by UIC students to
              rent lockers from multiple locations across campus. I headed the
              api and database portion of the project while I worked with a team
              member on the front-end. On this project I learned how to create a
              database schema with sql and create an api with the express
              framework. This project also allowed me to get better at
              communication with management, clients, and other developers.
