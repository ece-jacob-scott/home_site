            For my senior project I worked with a group of 3 other electrical
            and computer engineers to design an adaptable assistive foot pedal
            system. My contribution consisted of building all the software, our
            language of choice was python and I developed a library which used
            observers to interact with the arduino on the pedals. A developer
            could then use my library to integrate with applications on the
            users computer.

          The final assignment for a multimedia systems class was to implement
          an algorithm from any scholarly source. I decided to work on motion
          tracking using a strategy which analyses color video, this concept was
          originally used in game development in the early 2000's. I used Python
          for the project along with the libraries numpy and cv2.

          When I started working as a full stack developer at UIC my first
          project was to build the dining and nutrition menu application for
          resident students. The application informs UIC residents about what
          food is being served at the multiple cafeterias on campus with options
          to filter the options by day or dietary restrictions. This was the
          first front-end project I built using Vue and I'm very proud of how it
          turned out.

          The UIC locker registration site is a site used by UIC students to
          rent lockers from multiple locations across campus. I headed the api
          and database portion of the project while I worked with a team member
          on the front-end. On this project I learned how to create a database
          schema with sql and create an api with the express framework. This
          project also allowed me to get better at communication with
          management, clients, and other developers.
